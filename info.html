            <h2>Background</h2>
            This outbreak of the respiratory disease was first detected in China, and it has now been detected in almost 90 locations internationally, including the United States. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. 
            <br>
            <br>
            On January 30, 2020, the WHO World Health Organization declared the outbreak a “ public health emergency of international concern”. (PHEIC)
            <br>
            <br>
            While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Symptoms can include fever, cough, shortness of breath.

            <br> <br>
            <h2>Key Statistics</h2>
            1. Case number
            <br>
            Internationally: 107862
            <br>
            U.S.: 464

            <br>
            2. Death number
            <br>
            Internationally: 3666
            <br>
            U.S.: 19

            <br>
            3. Infection rate
            <br>
            While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%.  <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_2">here</a>
            <br> <br>
            <h2>How to prevent</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Wash your hand</li>
              Increasing the number of people with clean hands by 10% could slow down the rate at which disease can spread by as much as 24%.<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/why-hand-washing-really-could-slow-down-an-epidemic">here</a>
              <li>Wear a face mask if you are going to a crowded area</li>
              <li>Cover your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing</li>
              <li>Self-quarantine if you haven travel to areas where COVID-19 is spreading </li>
              <li>Wear a face mask if you </li>
              <li>Closely watch the news to see if your area is safe.  </li>
            </ul>
            <br> <br>
            <!-- <h2>In Class Activities </h2>

            We will be engaged in solving problems in class. You will work in groups to answer
            questions, discuss, and express your opinion. From time to time in class activities
            will be graded for completion.
            <br> <br>
            <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>

            Homework assignments are usually assigned on a weekly basis and they are usually due Fridays at 5:00 pm.
            The format of the homework and how to submit (electronically or on paper) will be detailed in the
            homework instructions. Homework assignemtnts have to be completed individually. You may not seek help
            from anyone except me or TAs. For each hour, homework assignments are submitted late,
            you will lose 10% of your grade. Thus if you submit your homework 10 hours later than it is due,
            you will not receive any points, however, you will still receive feedback.
            <br> <br>

            <h2>Labs</h2>
            You will be working on lab assignments during discussion sessions in groups.
            You will complete most lab assignments on RStudio Cloud. Labs are due to the end of discussion time.
            Further instructions on how to submit will be shared by your TAs during each discussion.
            If you are behind in the lab, seek help. If you are ahead provide help.
            <br><br>

            <h2>Midterm</h2>
            There will be one midterm exam and it is scheduled for Nov 4. The midterm will have both an in class
            and take-home part. For the take-home part you will have a week to complete. The in class part will be closed book but you will be given equations in the exam.
            You will need a scientific calculator. You will not be allowed to use a graphing calculator.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Final Exam</h2>
            Final exams are scheduled for Wed, Dec 11 (Section C) 08:00 -10:00 am and Fri, Dec 13 (Section D) 08:00 -10:00 am
            The final will have both an in class  and take-home part. For the take-home part you will have a week to complete.
            The in class part will be closed book but you will be given equations in the exam. The final will be cumulative.
            You will need a scientific calculator. You will not be allowed to use a graphing calculator.
            <br> <br>
            <h2>Extra credit</h2>

            There are certain circumstances that you will be granted extra credit:
            <ul>
              <li>Participation in Statistics and Data Science Related Competitions
            <ul>
              <li>National Competitions</li>
              <li>Statewide Competitions</li>
              <li>Campus Competitions</li>
            </ul> </li>
          </ul>

            The number of points awarded based on competitions will be at the
            discretion of the instructor based on the alignment of course goals and  the goals
            of the competition, your ranking in the competition, and the amount of time put
            into competition.

            There are certain circumstances that may be granted extra credit at the discretion
            of the instructor:

            <ul>
              <li>Asking "good" questions on Piazza: instructors, TAs, and graders can mark
              your question as good. Note that extra credit is only possible for multiple
            good question status. You should not try to achieve this status. Your focus should
          be using Piazza effectively then extra points may follow. </li>

          <li>Posting "good" answers on Piazza: instructors, TAs, and graders can mark
          your answers as good. Note that extra credit is only possible for multiple
        good question status. You should not try to achieve this status. Your focus should
      be using Piazza effectively then extra points may follow</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Communication Etiquette</h1>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Addressing People in Academia</h2>
            <br>
            Addressing people in academia might be one of the most difficult
            part of being in an academic setting. Below I try to lighten the general
            information with a side note that each academic has their own preference.

            <br> <br>

            <ul>
              <li>If a person already informs you about how you should call them please respect that.</li>
              <li>Undergraduate degrees may be followed up by master's and doctoral degrees. If a person has a doctoral degree than they can be
                referred as <i>Dr.</i> folowed by their last name. Yes, just like medical doctors! It may be hard to guess whether someone has a doctoral degree. If you are, for instance, emailing
              someone for an opportunity, make sure to check their website before emailing them. They may list their degrees. The most common doctoral degree
            is abbreviated as <i>Ph.D.</i> but there are other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doctoral_degrees_in_the_US">doctoral degrees</a>.
          Since the title <i>Dr.</i> is based on a degree, you can also use this title with anyone outside of academia if they have a doctoral degree.</li>
            <li>Even though many college professors have doctoral degrees, not all do. For instance, in the field of fine arts, master's degrees serve as the terminal degree.
            In other words, a fine arts professor may not have a doctorate but they have completed all the degree requirements to become a professor. For such academics
          who do not have a doctorate degree, you can refer to them as <i>Prof.</i> followed by their last name. You can also use the <i>Prof.</i> title with academics who
        have doctoral degrees. In short, the title Prof. comes with the job. </li>
        <li>The titles <i>Miss</i> and <i>Mrs.</i> are used for unmarried and married women respectively. In formal settings, since you are not aware of marital status
        of the woman you are referring to you can use <i>Ms.</i>. Use this title only with women who are not <i>Dr.</i> or  <i>Prof.</i>. The male title <i>Mr.</i>
      does not indicate marital status and can be used for men who are not <i>Dr.</i> or <i>Prof.</i>. Similarly the title <i>Mx.</i> does not indicate marital
    status and can be used for nonbinary people who are not <i>Dr.</i> or <i>Prof.</i>
    <li>Some people may prefer that you call them by their first name and some actually might find this rude. Unless you have been told to use first names,
    use one of the aforementioned titles. </li>

  </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Working in a group </h2>
            <br><br>
            Learning skills to work in a team efficiently is valuable. In a recent <a href="https://www.aacu.org/leap/public-opinion-research/2015-survey-falling-short">survey</a> conducted by Association of
            American and Colleges and Universities (AACU) found that employers ranked teamwork skills as one of
            the most valued skills and even more so than
            undergraduate major when hiring recent graduate skills.

            Understandably, team work comes with its challenges given your busy schedules and different interests. However,
            remember that work place teamwork will not be much different than your current teamwork experiences. Struggles
            may always rise but here are few ways to avoid them. When working in a group:
            <ul>
              <li>Communicate your schedule to other members clearly early on.</li>
              <li>Listen to your team members with an open mindset.</li>
              <li>Share your resources with your team members.</li>
              <li>Communicate frequently.</li>
              <li>Remember that the goal is to learn so help each other learn rather than just to get the work done.</li>

            </ul>
